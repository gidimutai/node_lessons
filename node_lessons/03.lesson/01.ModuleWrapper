Every mod. in nodejs gets wrapped in an iife before being loaded
IIFE helps keep top-level vars soped to the mod rather thanthe global obj.
The IIFE that wraps Every mod contains 5 parameters which are pretty important for the functioning of a mod

we have 5 wrappers in total they are export, require,module, __filename, __dirname
(function(export, require, module, __filename, __dirname){
  const superHero = "batman"
  console.log(superHero)
})
